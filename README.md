# mac_uninstall

With the proper API credentials, this script will uninstall Mac Sensor 6.x that requires an uninstall token.  Once done, the script will delete itself from the endpoint.

To run script you will need to pass your API ID and Secret as arguments.  This is to prevent the hard coding of credentials into the script.

Example: ./MacUninstallScript.sh -u <API_ID> -p <API_SECRET>
